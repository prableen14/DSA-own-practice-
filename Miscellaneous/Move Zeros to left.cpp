/*
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the starting (left) of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [0,0,1,3,12]

*/
/*
Keep two markers: read_index and write_index and point them to the end of the array. Letâ€™s take a look at an overview of the algorithm:
While moving read_index towards the start of the array:
If read_index points to 0, skip.
If read_index points to a non-zero value, write the value at read_index to write_index and decrement write_index.
Assign zeros to all the values before the write_index and to the current position of write_index as well.
