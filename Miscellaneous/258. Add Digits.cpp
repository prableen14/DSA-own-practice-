/*
Given an integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.

Example 1:
Input: num = 38
Output: 2
Explanation: The process is
38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2 
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Example 2:
Input: num = 0
Output: 0
 
Constraints:
0 <= num <= 231 - 1
 
Follow up: Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

/*Math's Explained :-
Any number where it's digits add to 9 is always divisible by 9. (18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, etc.)
Therefore the 'digital root' for any number divisible by 9 is always 9. 
You can see this even in larger numbers like 99 because 9 + 9 = 18, and then 1 + 8 = 9 still, so the root always becomes 9 for any numbers divisible by 9.
Additionally, 0 always has a digital root of 0 obviously.
The only other cases you need to worry about to find the digital root are when it isn't 0 or 9.
So for any number that isn't 0 and isn't divisible by 9, the root will always n % 9 for a given number n. 
(AKA the difference between given number n and the nearest number that is divisible by 9, since numbers divisible by 9 always have a digital root of 9).
For examples: 100 % 9 = 1 (one greater than 99, which is divisible by 9).
101 % 9 = 2
102 % 9 = 3 and so on.

This explanation/algorithm skips the whole "add digits until there is only 1 remaining", 
so the description of this problem seems pretty misleading to me since it makes you think the solution will be something unrelated to the optimal one. 
I guess the point of Leetcode is to learn all of these tricks though.
